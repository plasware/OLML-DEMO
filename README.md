OLML DEMO version. You can open jupyter files to see the mechanism of our work without running.
To run OLML, you need to use git clone command to get model in "models" folder.
To use model selection function, we package a file of data in /ModelSelection/fine_selection_files.zip. Unzip them to use.
This version is a prototype. We are glad to hear your advise.
