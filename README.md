This is demonstration version of OLML. You can open jupyter file (.ipynb) to see the mechanism of OLML.

To use Model Selection, unzip the file in /ModelSelection.

Model needs to be added to run our new operator. Please get models from HuggingFace since github restricts the size of files. An example is given here: [plasware/SentimentClsEN Â· Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/plasware/SentimentClsEN)

This is a prototype and we are glad to hear your advice.
