1	This is just a precious little diamond. The play, the script are excellent. I cant compare this movie with anything else, maybe except the movie "Leon" wonderfully played by Jean Reno and Natalie Portman. But... What can I say about this one? This is the best movie Anne Parillaud has ever played in (See please "Frankie Starlight", she's speaking English there) to see what I mean. The story of young punk girl Nikita, taken into the depraved world of the secret government forces has been exceptionally over used by Americans. Never mind the "Point of no return" and especially the "La femme Nikita" TV series. They cannot compare the original believe me! Trash these videos. Buy this one, do not rent it, BUY it. BTW beware of the subtitles of the LA company which "translate" the US release. What a disgrace! If you cant understand French, get a dubbed version. But you'll regret later :)
2	When I say this is my favourite film of all time, that comment is not to be taken lightly. I probably watch far too many films than is healthy for me, and have loved quite a few of them. I first saw "La Femme Nikita" nearly ten years ago, and it still manages to be my absolute favourite. Why?<br /><br />This is more than an incredibly stylish and sexy thriller. Luc Besson's great flair for impeccable direction, fashion, and appropriate usage of music makes this a very watchable film. But it is Anne Parillaud's perfect rendering of a complex character who transforms from a heartless killer into a compassionate, vibrant young woman that makes this film beautiful. I can't keep my eyes off of her when she is on screen.<br /><br />I have seen several of Luc Besson's films including "Subway", "The Professional", and the irritating "Fifth Element", and "Nikita" is without a doubt, far superior to any of these. Although this film has tragic elements, it is ultimately extremely hopeful. It is the story of a person who is cruel and merciless, who ultimately comes to realize her own humanity and her own personal power. That, to me is extremely inspiring. If there is hope for Nikita, there is hope for all of us.
3	I saw this movie because I am a huge fan of the TV series of the same name starring Roy Dupuis and Pet Wilson. The movie was really good and I saw how the TV show is based on the movie. A few episodes of the TV series came directly from the movie and their similarity was amazing. To keep things short, any fan of the movie has to watch the series and any fan of the series must see the original Nikita.
4	Being that the only foreign films I usually like star a Japanese person in a rubber suit who crushes little tiny buildings and tanks, I had high hopes for this movie. I thought that this was a movie that wouldn't put me to sleep. WRONG! Starts off with a bang, okay, now she's in training, alright, she's an assassin, I'm still with you, oh, now she's having this moral dilemma and she can't decide if she loves her boyfriend or her controller, zzzzz.... Oh well, back to Gamera!
5	After seeing Point of No Return (a great movie) and being told that the original was better, I was certainly thrilled to see that one of the indie film channels was running La Femme Nikita. Then I saw the movie. Ouch! This was a major let-down.<br /><br />Nikita herself reminds me of Jar Jar Binks more than any other character I've seen recently. She comes across entirely as comic relief. The movie simply has nothing to recommend it besides the core concept of an evil, inhuman character paradoxically learning to be human while training as an assassin, and that concept failed miserably in Nikita due to the poor writing of the title role.
6	Stylish thriller? Hardly! This French action film from director Luc Besson is more confused and unsure about itself than anything else I have seen recently.<br /><br />The opening action sequence shows some promise, and the following action sequences are good. However they are sadly too few and far between. The drama is dull and erratic, and the characters are generally unlikeable. Anne Parillaud and the support cast are unable to involve the audience emotionally.<br /><br />"La Femme Nikita" ends up more like a try hard, B-grade action thriller. Very average!<br /><br />Saturday, April 28, 1991 - Balwyn Cinema
7	A Luc Besson (Léon, The Fith Element, The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc. Angel-A) film with Anne Parillaud (Innocent Blood), Tchéky Karyo(The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc, The Patriot, Kiss of the Dragon) and Jean Reno (Léon , The Crimson Rivers, Godzilla). It doesn't get better than this.<br /><br />The photography by Thierry Arbogast was perfect, especially the blue lighting at the pharmacy scene. It is easy to see why Besson uses him for his films. He is a master.<br /><br />Parillaud was absolutely magnificent in a character that was a strong woman, and a little girl at the same time. She was a profession, but she was also human. To see this instead of the comic book characters we are so familiar with is refreshing.<br /><br />Reno was a perfect cleaner. Hard and professional. Get the mission done.<br /><br />Jean-Hugues Anglade added just the right touch of sensitivity. Outstanding! There are just not enough superlatives to use in describing the acting and action in the film.
8	This isn't my typical movie genre. I am more interested in character drama than action movies. This is able to span both genres in a way that Hollywood hasn't managed to accomplish. The plot was interesting and the acting by Anne Parillaud was exceptional.<br /><br />I had seen the American remake, called "Point of No Return" and found it to be an OK movie, but I wanted to see the original. I am glad that I did. The technical aspects of direction and editing are very good. The plot was interesting - revolving around the timeless theme of redemption. The acting made this an exceptional movie.<br /><br />For fans of the action genre, they will be quite happy. For those like myself who are more interested in character and plot-driven movies may find this to be a pleasant surprise as well.
9	La Femme Nikita (1990) was a great movie from genre director Luc Besson. The story is about a drugged out young woman (Anne Parillund) who's hung out with the wrong crowd one too many times. During a botched drug store robbery and subsequent shoot out with the police, NIkita is the only survivor. She's tried, sentenced and executed. But, she wakes up in a strange room and greeted by a quiet and subdued individual (Tcheky Kayro) he tells her that she's been given a second chance at life. But will she do what needs to be done in order for her to receive. Will Nikita take this opportunity at a second life or will she throw it all away? Watch LA FEMME NIKITA to find out.<br /><br />The always imitated by never properly duplicated chic thriller has become a fixture in pop culture. Not only was this film remade several times but it also spawned an unrelated television series. Anne Parillund is super hot in her role as Nikita. Watch out for Luc Besson regular Jean Reno as Victor the Cleaner.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
10	Luc Besson has been behind some of the most provocative and intriguing action films of the last 15 years, and his introduction to mainstream American cinema-goers began with 1991's "La Femme Nikita." Beginning with a drug store shootout that leaves three junkie punkers and a few policemen dead, this film is rapidly engaging and shows off Besson's violent chic. In the fray, only young Nikita (Anne Parillaud) survives, after offing a policeman who had let his guard down at a crucial moment. Facing certain death in France's court of law, she is given two choices: lethal injection, or have her execution faked, and then assume a new life as a female super-assassin/spy. A wild-raised feral child of sorts, Nikita had picked up certain skills on the street that eventually prove to be quite valuable to her government handlers, as she makes things difficult for them and especially her chief mentor Bob (Tcheky Karyo). No secret is made of his affections for her, but he tries to mold Nikita into a valuable person, and he's able to do it with the help of another agent, played by actress Jeanne Moreau, who teaches her the finer ways of womanhood. By the end of her training, Nikita has been modeled into a fine, sexy female assassin. Besson makes no attempts to sacrifice his film in the ways of Hollywood convention, and he proves that the days of female-driven action cinema are not yet dead. Parillaud is compelling, as at first, she almost seems unaware of her identity as a woman. When she isn't taking out high-powered political officials, she's romancing a kind and gentle shop clerk, who falls madly in love with her as she does with him. Lastly, "La Femme Nikita" has some of the most stylized and violent action scenes of any movie I've seen in a while. Luc Besson, with this film and much of his subsequent work, has proved he is one of cinema's most valuable personalities on the European, Asian, and American action film circuits. Also, be aware of a cameo by future Besson "Leon" (1994) star Jean Reno as Victor the Cleaner, in what is pretty much an early prototype of his role from that star-making breakthrough film.<br /><br />8/10
11	This isn't the worst comedy of all-time, but that is about the best thing that I can say about this pathetic film. I didn't laugh once, or even smile once during this bomb. There was usually something going on on-screen, so I didn't get TOO bored, but most of the jokes here were simply awful. The final sequence is nothing more than a long series of people falling through doors and stumbling all over the place. Needless to say, it was a fitting way to end a movie that was impossible for me to like.
12	A lot of people criticize this movie as just being too dumb, but I'm just saying, give this movie a chance. It may not be the best film ever made, but at least it has clever gags in it and also includes a very young John Candy. I saw clips of the movie on the internet and I was amazed on how they were funny, especially the scene when Candy unintentionally almost destroys the entire police station while trying to find a pencil or when he hilariously fails his shooting test in the gun range. Since this movie was barely released in the U.S., you may want to track down a copy of it before it disappears completely. Also look for Peter Cook, Mickey Rooney, and Dick Emery, in what was to be his last film role, in the cast, as well.
13	Before John Candy was really famous, he starred in this rather silly Canadian movie about a series of kidnappings. He plays police officer Kopek, investigating the kidnappings and getting into a bunch of loopy situations along the way. The only other cast member whom I recognized was Mickey Rooney, playing a trigger-happy hit-man named Trigger (although apparently, Peter Cook also starred).<br /><br />Overall, "Find the Lady" is nothing special, mostly a series of gags, but it's pretty fun, especially the end scene. I guess that you could say that it backs up what Michael Moore always says: Canada is the greatest place on earth.
14	Groucho are Carmen Miranda are Marvooolussss together. What a great combination and beauty and the beast. The movie has it all, cheesey musicals, goofy love scenes and Groucho's one liners. Buy it if you are a Groucho fan.
15	In New York City, Lionel Q. Devereaux (Groucho Marx) and his fiancée Carmen Novarro (Carmen Miranda) are unsuccessfully trying to find a spot in the show business. Lionel introduces himself to Steve Hunt (Steve Cochran), who owns the famous Copacabana nightclub, as an important agent and convinces Steve to see the presentation of Carmen. He enjoys the show and asks for another attraction; Lionel convinces Carmen to wear a veil and perform another song and introduces her to Steve as the French singer Mademoiselle Fifi. Steve hires both singers and Carmen has to change clothes and identities between her performances. When she sees Lionel flirting with a Copa Girl, Mlle. Fifi accepts the invitation to have dinner with Steve, hurting the feelings of his secretary Anne Stuart (Gloria Jean) that is in love with him. The situation gets complicated and Carmen simulates an argument with Mlle. Fifi with her subsequent disappearance, originating an investigation of the police where the prime suspect is Lionel. <br /><br />"Copacabana" is a delightfully naive and entertaining movie from a time when the society was extremely innocent and could buy such ingenuous story. The plot, i.e., the double-identity of Carmen Miranda, is totally absurd but the situation of Lionel after the disappearance of Mlle. Fifi was remade by Billy August in 1963 in "Irma La Douce". Groucho Marx is funny and responsible for the best moments of this movie; but the subplots with the silly romance of Anne and Steve, and the participation of the weird singer Andy Russell should be better written. The songs are boring and dated in 2009, but Carmen Miranda was very successful in those years and sings the famous "Tico-Tico no Fubá". My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Copacabana"
16	The eyebrow-wagging Lionel Q. Deveraux (Groucho Marx) is tired of dragging down the career of his fiancée, Carmen Novarro (Carmen Miranda), as the untalented half of their nightclub act and quits to become her agent. His powers of persuasion soon get the Brazilian singer a job as a featured performer at the Copacabana - twice over. She is forced to do double duty as herself and as Mlle. Fifi, a veil-covered Parisian chanteuse. The owner of the Copacabana, Steve Hunt (Steve Cochran), insists on romancing Mlle. Fifi, much to the frustration of Deveraux, who has already staked his claim to Carmen. Also frustrated is Anne Stuart (Gloria Jean), Steve's dutiful secretary, who is secretly in love with her boss. Another Copacabana singer, Andy Russell (himself), plays Cupid.<br /><br />An irritatingly stupid script, poor production values and almost no good lines for Groucho spoil this slight musical comedy. Andy Russell, who can sing but can't act, cancels himself out. Carmen Miranda fans may want to skip over everything except her numbers, which are good. Groucho fans may want to skip this altogether, unless they want to laugh at the awfulness of it all and imagine the sarcastic quipster delivering a scathing commentary track.
17	While I prefer Groucho's humor the most amongst all three Marx brothers, it's just not the same without Chico and Harpo for Groucho to play off of. <br /><br />I had never seen Carmen Miranda in action, though I had long known of her being a performer with kooky hats. Now that I've seen her on screen, I think she comes across as a cross between Marlene Dietrich and Charo - a surprisingly fun mix. She's actually a good foil for Groucho, so I think it's the screenplay that doesn't play to their full potentials. It's still a fairly charming movie, with Carmen taking on the role of two different stage performers and Groucho providing zingers.
18	After reading the positive comments here and seeing the 1 star rating on my digital cable guide, I decided to give it a chance (plus, I'm a big Alan Arkin fan after seeing him in 'Catch-22', 'Glengarry Glen Ross', and 'Little Murders'). And I have to say that it's not as bad as it's made out to be. It's actually really really funny--if you have a certain sense of humor. I was dying with laughter during the scene where Arkin and Rob Reiner started fighting on the father's bed--on top of the father! There were other good scenes: the kids throwing the rocks through the windows, Arkin approaching the basketball player on the court, the crazy Jewish mother throughout the whole movie, "Keep Out Putz!" written on the office door and the scene with the comatose dad and the insurance guys. I could go on because I really liked this movie. The only thing that kinda bugged was Rob Reiner's attacks, but eh. What are you gonna do?<br /><br />I think that you have to enjoy a certain type of humor to find this movie funny. During the whole thing I found myself drawing parallels to my favorite sitcom, Arrested Development. Crazy dysfunctional family? Check. Adopting a kid of a completely different race for personal gain? Check. Buring down a business for money? Check. (Episode 2 of Season 1--Top Banana!) Multiple story lines that culminate into one big finale? Yup. And there was even a big wacky ending involving all the family members. Both are very slapstick-y comedies with both dry and over the top jokes. If you love that kind of humor, then you'll really like Fire Sale. If you're more into standard comedies, then you'll probably become very easily annoyed and change the channel.<br /><br />I'd love to see a cheap DVD of this movie out in a letterbox format. I remember Fox Movie Channel used to run some kind of promo trailer/short documentary before showing it, so I'd love to see that as well. Plus, some of the scenes are very dark. I'm not sure if this is the print of the movie or Arkin's intention, but it would be nice to see this movie remastered and released in the future, but that probably won't happen. A girl can dream though!
19	Four stars? - give me a break!<br /><br />I was thrilled and amused when I saw this as a kid - so many unconventional scenes, so many people who don't behave ...<br /><br />Alright this is not that entertaining for people of today who have lost any attention span. And it's not as brilliantly made as "Where's Poppa?", also written by Robert Klane, but it does have its moments, i.e. most scenes that Arkin and Gardenia are in. Reiner is pretty inept here as usual, though. Kay Medford is very good as a Mother out of touch with reality. A good cast in general.<br /><br />Some scenes lack a better execution but on the whole this is an original idea that has several subplots which are nicely tied up. Greed, ineptness, dysfunctional families, madness and irritation manifest themselves in many different ways. <br /><br />Most locations are pretty "awful" by today's viewing habits but that is the exact charm of this movie as opposed to all the slick and sterile over-produced forgettable comedies of today. The settings make this movie look "real" and might tend to make people uneasy about the story because it seems people don't really get their way - no matter how they try. That makes for good comedy because this is how life is when you constantly overreach: You make a fool of yourself.<br /><br />The main problem with this seems to be that the ideas are funny but better production and direction would not have hurt. This could very well be remade but I doubt people today want to see anyone on the screen who is over 40 years old... And that is pathetic.
20	I'm another one who is waiting for the day this movie comes out on video. I also laughed from start to finish, especially when Alan Arkin discovers the basketball phenom. This movie was wayyyy ahead of its time, and those that didn't laugh just don't get the jokes!
21	The movie is a bit sloppy from a technical standpoint, but it remains the only movie to make me literally laugh myself sick. The Farrelly brothers owe a huge debt to Robert Klane's mining of the twisted humor genre. For years, this was my video holy grail. Finally, it occurred to me that it probably showed up from time to time on the Fox Movie Channel; so, not having it on my cable system, I started buying the monthly satellite programming guides, and when it came up in the rotation on FMC, I had a friend tape it for me. A simple DVD release will not be adequate. This needs the full Special Edition treatment. And oh, how I hope there are outtakes.
22	This film is about 30 years old. I know of no conversions to tape or DVD. It had a theatrical run of about two weeks partially due to a bad review but nobody I ever met who saw it disliked the picture. The reviewer either never actually saw the entire film or had an agenda to sink it. When I first saw it my girlfriend (who isn't Jewish) and I and the vast majority of the audience, were roaring with laughter. We returned a number of times with friends and family and everyone loved it.<br /><br />13 years later I had the privilege of having Sid Ceasar in my car (I was hired to take him to his hotel) and I asked him about the film. He said that he had a lot of fun making the movie, but the studio provided very limited money to advertise and promote the product. No press, no promotion. Studio politics.<br /><br />Gardenia (overbearing father) and Medford (sweet, but loopy wife and mother) are the parents of Arkin, the older son who lives outside the family home and Reiner (intimidated, milquetoast) who lives in. The family owns a failing, indebted department store. Arkin is married to Anjanette Comer, who desperately wants a child. Arkin claims he is impotent because of the tyranny of his father and the fact that he is the hated high school basketball coach whose team can't even win one game. Ceasar plays a wacky WWII patient at the the VA hospital who still believes that the war is still ongoing.<br /><br />On a road trip to Florida, Gardenia secretly sets into motion a scheme to burn his Dept. store down and collect the Fire Insurance. Arkin and Reiner think that his parents' absence presents the perfect opportunity to prove their father wrong and refurbish and restock the store and make a success of it. They don't know of the plot and go to work. Ceasar as Gardenia's unwitting foil is priceless. The pace of the film accelerates and is replete with a few clever twists. This effort is worth a sincere second look and a re-release.
23	Rob Reiner is hilarious. I haven't seen the movie in a long time and have trouble finding it everywhere. Some of the humor is ethnic, but to me seems pretty harmless, as well as very funny. I thought there was a lot of good slapstick and madcap silliness.<br /><br />I'm not sure why the movie is not more available in stores or on different internet sites where some individual who had the interest in buying a movie like this would be able to have the opportunity to purchase a funny and entertaining and humorous movie such as this particular movie was.<br /><br />If you can find it, give it a try.
24	Alan Arkin, Rob Reiner, Vincent Gardenia, Alex Rocco, Kay Medford, Sid Caeser and a 7 foot tall black teenager named Captain F*@% in the most Jewish movie ever made. As I watched this on Fox Movie Channel earlier tonight I wasn't laughing -- because my mouth was hanging open too wide. Where to begin? Where?!? This movie has the highest per capita amount of asthma jokes I've ever seen. Just when you think there are no more laughs to get out of an asthma joke -- there's another! And all Ruthie wants is to visit her sister in Florida (pronounced Flaaaaahrida.) Need I mention that the patriarch of the family is in the garment business? And he has a sign on his door for his son to read which says "Keep Out Putz?" Need I mention that everyone talks down to the Spanish speaking men painting the house? Need I mention that Ruthie won't allow her husband to attend such an occasion in a sports jacket and slacks? Need I mention that Alan Arkin refers to the refrigerator as "the icebox?" Oh. . .oh, I'm starting to palpitate. This film is unavailable on DVD or VHS, but Fox Movie Network is pretty good about rerunning things. If they show it again, I am taping it.
25	I agree totally with the others. Fire Sale is one of the funniest comedies ever made. <br /><br />I have not read Maltin's review. But if it is negative, the man is suspect.<br /><br />As for the few who were extremely critical of the movie, I'm speechless. How could one not love this film? It is one side-splitting scene after another. It is nigh impossible to summarize it. One has to experience it. Further more, it is Jewish comedy at its very best. They don't make films like this anymore. <br /><br />Like the others, I have searched for this film in nearly 25 years. I would welcome contact from anyone who can help me find a copy.
26	I saw this movie as a motel movie shortly after vcr's became affordable/popular.<br /><br />I thought it was very funny and would love to see it again on DVD or tape.<br /><br />The rather subtle, dry humor mixed with slapstick comedy was very well done. I would certainly buy it if it were available.
27	I saw this a couple of times in the late seventies. My parents had just subscribed to this new service called Cable TV, and low and behold we had a movie channel called Showtime. I watched it every day it was on. It gives new meaning to the word "Putz". I really wish it would be released on video/DVD. I don't understand why it hasn't been. It is sad that another generation hasn't had the opportunity to share the laughs.
28	this movie must be re-released. a whole generation of comedy fans is missing out on one of the classic comedies of all time. if you have never seen this movie please contact your congressman and your clergyman and demand that they contact whoever it is that they serve and bring this movie to the publics attention.
29	The movie was incredible, ever since I saw it in 1977 I told my wife she had to see it, it was really funny. Right up there with the "In-Laws." As soon as it came out on video we would watch it. Well, 20 years later, and every time I ask in a video store they give me a funny look. Does anyone have any clue how this classic can be viewed??? "PLEASE HELP"
30	Though it's now been 24 years since I saw it, I still remember thinking that I should have walked out of the theater.. No one in the audience laughed even once. The only one laughing was the person who took our money for the tickets.
31	I rate it a 10 by how it affected me when I first saw it on television years ago, probably '78 or '79. I've only seen it once, yet I still remember it, and thanks to IMDb, I finally found the info on it. It might be horrible if I viewed it now, some things don't hold up well through the years. That being said, all I can remember is laying on the floor watching the television and beating the carpet I was laughing so hard, and my best friend called screaming through the phone, wheezing like he was going to die--he was watching it also. We didn't throw up, but we definitely couldn't breathe, it was that good at the time. I hope it comes out someday on DVD so I can give it the test. Until then, I still fondly give it a 10. (And Leonard Maltin is not right a lot of the time! Don't let him sway you.)
32	I remember seeing "Firesale" on HBO in 1978. I was 15 years old. My friend and I laughed so hard we could not control ourselves. The details are so sketchy now which is sad, but I never forgot that movie. I don't understand why it never went anywhere and is now completely unavailable. This movie needs to be rediscovered. It would be awesome to see it again. Can anyone help? Can we contact Rob Reiner and get his copy? Ha Ha. There are so many ridiculously stupid movies. I have seen most of them. This is sad. Of all the movies to not be able to see, I wish it was'nt this one. Seriously, if anyone knows were to get a copy of this movie, please write to me. I would greatly appreciate it. thank you.
33	I'm sorry, but I must respectfully disagree with Mr. Sam H. Franklin's review of this movie. There is, in fact, one laugh in the entire movie. It's the scene where Al (played by the always great Alex Rocco) is telling the wimpy Russel (Rob Reiner) how all the merchandise in the store is outdated. And he throws the clothes off the mannequins, and the last mannequin turns out to be an old lady. That was the one funny scene in the movie. The old lady ended up partially naked later on in the movie, but it wasn't nearly as funny. Oh, and Sid Caesar did a couple of things which may be construed as humor, though that is certainly a subjective construct. Other than that, this is a truly horrid movie. I thought it would at least have kitschy value, which it almost does; but it's not worth it anyway. Rob Reiner should have directed.
34	I watch "Fire Sale" at least 3-4 times a year and each time it gets better, very similar to "Where's Poppa", which also demands multiple viewings. While "Where's Poppa" has one extremely funny story line, "Fire Sale" has two. The insurance scam running parallel to the basketball player / adoption are absolutely two of the funniest ideas in any film. My only criticism is that Alan Arkin lets several scenes run on entirely too long. Nevertheless, there are moments of hilarious dark comedy throughout. "And don't forget to put my beer back", measuring a "live corpse", etc. This is one of the greatest comedies ever made, and will achieve instant cult status if ever released on DVD. - MERK
35	 after 16 minutes anyway. Not that it detracts from a nice little comedy-mystery, but this was an even cheaper affair than usual from RKO as they used up a lot of stock rustic Mexican background film to lilting music here while the main characters glided or drove about in front. Tom Conway as the Falcon looked as handsome and debonair as ever (no. 9/13  I don't count those last 3 non-RKO efforts with John Calvert), and had to do without the comedy double act of Clark and Gargan from now on.<br /><br />Investigation of a painting painted by a dead man (with an art gallery eerily similar to the one in Woman In The Window) leads to murder and theft; the Falcon is chased by the cops while he's chasing the baddies all the way into deepest Mexico. The dead painter's daughter was played chockful of feminine intuition by Martha Vickers, next step for her was the cute Big Sleep. She also uttered my favourite line from all of the Falcon films  "My father lived at this inn while he was alive"  wonderful stuff! Nestor Paiva played a helpful ambiguous peasant and Joseph Vitale a rather unhelpful serious dancer, some of their best stuff was to come later with Paramount. The only downer was the climax could've been handled with a little more sensitivity, but in these pics time was money!<br /><br />Another excellent and engrossing Falcon outing for the cognoscenti, serious people shouldn't waste their valuable time.
36	This is the ninth Falcon film, and a particularly good one. It contains some very good second unit material shot in Mexico, so there must have been a large budget for that, as it must have taken at least two or three weeks on location. It took a lot of editing to intercut all that with the actors back home in the studio. Tom Conway is in fine form, and there is some crackling dialogue as usual: 'Are you following me around?' 'I've been doing nothing else since we first met.' No prizes for figuring out who said that. There are excellent performances from two Hispanic actors, Fernando Alvarado is a charming little Mexican boy, and Nestor Paiva is excellent in a major supporting role. Martha Vickers is suitably alluring and ambiguous as a typical Falcon heroine. One would like to have some time alone with her in her dressing room (just for research purposes, of course). The plot is solid, a truly puzzling mystery this time, with so many possible villains that the fingers on both hands seem hardly sufficient. This is an excellent unpretentious B picture, just the sort of thing one wants in the Falcon series.
37	Michael Arlen's radio-serial detective returns for another movie mystery (actually, it's the Falcon's brother this time, with George Sanders having since exited from the role and his real-life sibling Tom Conway assuming his duties). For reasons unknown, the Falcon is down Mexico way, being conned by a Señorita who needs his help in retrieving one of her paintings from an art gallery. They break in after-hours (despite a sign near the door in English saying the premises are guarded by the police!), only to find a dead man on the premises. Globe-trotting yarn wants us to believe that New York City and Mexico are just a stone's throw from each other, or that the Falcon is really just a nice guy used to helping out desperate women. Neither washes, with the solving of the crime is rather rote and unexciting. *1/2 from ****
38	Two or even three movies for the price of one! The first is a travelog that was shot somewhere south of the US border. There are some excellent scenes of local fishermen and the culture of ordinary folks. Rumor has it that these are from Orsen Wells circa 1942. The second movie is unabashed marketing for tourism in Mexico - the last shot is of a tourist poster that melts into a plane flying to or from our neighbor to the south. The third movie is a lackluster mystery of sorts with Tom Lawrence at his worst. It is not that all of his Falcon movies are terrible, some are decent. The Falcon in Mexico is not one of his stellar performances and not really worth your time viewing. Half an hour after the movie, you won't rember who did it or care. Costume design by Renié.
39	This is one of my very favorite shows WWF/E has put on. Forgive me, I haven't watched this in almost 2 years, so my memory may be a bit fuzzy. <br /><br />European Championship - Probably my favorite opening match of all time, D-Lo Brown VS Val Venis was far better (and longer!) than I could have possibly hoped for. Two very capable (and horribly underutilized) guys getting 15 minutes (!!!!) to shine on a huge show...thumbs up! Great stuff! If you're ever wondering why they kept these 2 around for so long, check out this match. <br /><br />Oddities VS Kaientai - Nothing too special here, basically a comedy match. In that sense, it was well done. A couple funny spots, and Kaientai is always money. But all in all, they're wasted here.<br /><br />Hair VS Hair: Jeff Jarrett VS X-Pac - Nothing much to say. I forget the majority of this match, it was nothing spectacular. Then again, I actively dislike both of these guys, so this could have been pretty good and I just ignored it. Check for yourself.<br /><br />Sable/Edge VS Marc Mero/Jackie - Edge fans, pick up this show for Edge's debut! Nothing spectacular, Edge and Mero looking OK, Sable trying her best not to maim anyone with botched moves. Fairly early in her wrestling career, so don't expect anything special. <br /><br />Ken Shamrock VS Owen Hart: Lion's Den Match - Not a technical masterpiece, but very solid, given the environment. Limited space for movement inside the modified cage/lion's den seems to handcuff both guys, but they made it work. Worth watching, if only to see something you might not have see before (this type of match occurred only twice, I believe, and the other replaces Hart with Steve Blackman....who would YOU rather watch??)<br /><br />Tag Team Championship: New Age Outlaws VS Mankind/Kane - Kane no shows, leaving Mankind to defend on his own. If you're a Foley fan, check this out. No one takes a stiff butt kickin like Foley, and there are few examples of that as good as this. Nothing close to the spectacle of some of his other matches, this one is brutally short, emphasis on the 'brutal'<br /><br />Intercontinental Championship Ladder Match - What a great match. This stands out in my mind as the match that 'made' Rock and HHH. Up until this point, they were upper midcarders leading their respective factions. This match proved to me that they're both very capable of working a main-event caliber match and delivering HUGE. Not as much emphasis placed on high spots in this match, it seems to focus more on (again) brutality and storytelling. VERY well done, one of the forgotten great matches. <br /><br />World Championship Steve Austin VS Undertaker - A very well done match, especially considering Austin was knocked silly when they knocked heads about 3 or 4 minutes in. Not the greatest match of all time, but an important match nonetheless. The second PPV title match for these two, the first with Austin defending. Great (and unexpected) high spot features Undertaker attempting a huge legdrop from the top turnbuckle onto the announce table. Impressive visual for a guy that size. Good match, great show, check it out!
40	Match 1: D'Lo Brown (c) vs Val Venis for the European Championship - Pretty decent opener. Back in the late 90's D'Lo could really work a decent match, but as of his recent performances on Raw in 2008 I'm not impressed anymore. So basically these two go at it for with WWE's now defunct European title on the line. Venis looked pretty good in the ring, his character was still relatively fresh at this time. But anyway towards the end of the match Val gets himself disqualified, which means D'Lo retains the title.<br /><br />Match 2: The Oddities (Kurrgan, Golga and Giant Silva) (with Luna Vachon and The Insane Clown Posse) vs Kaientai (Taka Michinoku, Dick Togo, Mens Teioh and Sho Funaki) (with Yamaguchi-san) in a Handicap Match - Extremely weak match. I did like the Oddities as comic relief, but guys like Kurrgan and Golga did better as singles wrestlers. This, as J.R. says in the commentary, is not a classic. Anyway the Oddities squash their way to a victory over Kaientai.<br /><br />Match 3: Jeff Jarrett vs X-Pac in a Hair vs Hair Match - The first good match of the night. These two put out a very crowd pleasing match at this particular Summerslam. X-Pac is able to score the win, but Jarrett retreats from getting his hair cut. He is brought back to the ring shortly and they cut his formerly long hair into the look he had all through WCW and in TNA.<br /><br />Match 4: Marc Mero & Jacqueline vs Edge & Sable - A great way to get the young Edge over. Edge has always been tremendous in the ring, and even though he faces off with the talentless Marc Mero, he still manages to put on a decent match. In the end Edge and Sable get the win.<br /><br />Match 5: Ken Shamrock vs Owen Hart in a Lion's Den match - This match was off the hook. Owen Hart completely ruled the ring, if it wasn't for his death he would have been WWE Champion at some point. This match was absolutely awesome. Shamrock is able to defeat Owen in the end, but I still applaud Owen because he was such a great wrestler. He's a guy that needs to be in the WWE Hall of Fame.<br /><br />Match 6: Mankind (c) vs The New Age Outlaws for the WWF/E Tag Team Championship - This was just a low and lame match. Kane is the tag team partner of Mankind, but he doesn't show. So Mankind is left to fend alone against Road Dogg and Billy Gunn. In the end they get the win over Mankind and claim the Tag Titles again.<br /><br />Match 7: The Rock (c) vs Triple H in a Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Championship - The match of the night. These two incredible veterans put out a great match. At this point both the Rock and the Game were on the verge of becoming main eventers, and I think this match made it for them. Honestly a fantastic, must watch, match. In the end Triple H grabs the title to win.<br /><br />Match 8: Stone Cold Steve Austin (c) vs Undertaker for the WWF/E Championship - Great main event. Really one of Summerslam's best matches of all time. Madison Square Garden completely was behind Austin as he went into battle with the Undertaker for his championship. After a vicious battle, Austin hits the Stunner to retain the title. Crowd was completely ecstatic.
41	This ppv was made even better by one of the greatest rock songs ever Highway to Hell and the ppv was so great, one of the best ppvs ever! And the ppv started with a very hot opener with D-Lo Brown and Val Venis which got a surprising 15 minutes and the two men made the best of it! Oddities took on Kaientai in a fun match, X-Pac took on Jarrett in a haircut match, Edge was Sable's surprise partner as they took on Marc Mero and Jacqueline, Shamrock took on Owen Hart in a boring lions den match, Mankind went alone in a handicap hardcore match against the Outlaws which only lasted 5 minutes but it was pretty brutal for the 5 minutes, Triple H and the Rock had a decent ladder match but can't be compared to others, and in the main event Steve Austin defended the world title against the Undertaker, overall another good Summerslam and one of the best ever
42	The truth is that about 80% of the people who see (have seen) this movie won't like it. Why? Because it is not that original. But in saying that, I happen to belong to the 20% who really like it.<br /><br />I first saw it back in the eighties when I was about 8 or 9 years old. Now almost 20 years on I saw it again, and it really brought back nostalgic memories from when I was a kid.<br /><br />Some people say this movie has bad acting. I don't agree at all. While the story might not be the best ever, there is definitely nothing wrong with the acting. And the supersonic Maiden One plane looks absolutely stunning, even though it is 70's B-TV-movie material.<br /><br />I really recommend it to fans of disaster movies. It is hard to get a hold of these days, but if you have a chance to see it, do so.
43	Let me say straight away that this movie is toxic waste for the mind. This movie is not watchable because it has a good story; it doesn't. It's not watchable because there's good acting; there is none. It's watchable because of the cast. This will take you down TV memory lane...how many former TV stars can you pick out?<br /><br />As with any TV "Movie of the Week", the drawing power is in the stars. The story involves the inaugural flight of "Maiden One" the first supersonic transport plane. (The movie ignores the fact that it was a British-French conglomerate that first built the Concorde, and had to sue for the right to land in America during this time.) In this movie, we have a disgruntled worker who sabotages the flight by putting detergent in the hydraulic lines in order to get revenge on his boss (Burgess Meredith).<br /><br />We also have Doug McClure trying to get back into Tina Louise's pants, Billy Crystal playing a rather fey steward, John Delancie in training for his future role as Q, and Peter Graves as one half of a former May-December romance. Did I mention that there also happens to be a plot line about the airplane carrying the Senegal flu, which is now spreading among the crew? If you don't have sabotage, you've got the untamed strain of flu floating around.<br /><br />There are two references that date this movie. One is a reference to the "Swine flu". The other is the way that Burt Convy discusses abortion with his bimbo girlfriend -- the concept is mentioned, but she won't let him say the word.<br /><br />The movie does have a reverse natural selection -- the megastars like Meredith & Graves die, but losers like Convy, McClure, etc. live to make another bad TV movie. Check out the cameo of Regis Philbin (and his hair) as an annoying TV reporter.<br /><br />Sterno says SST Death Flight is a guilty pleasure.
44	This, according to most, was not the best film of all time! And, perhaps they're right, but one never knows just what can happen when you see a film. My winter vacation had already been planned when, one Monday evening in February 1982, I saw "SST: Disaster in the Sky" (one of its other names). It only took me 'til Friday to call my travel agent and change my destination from Columbus, Ohio to Dakar, Senegal. I took off within a few days and with no hotel, old French and a small bag, I landed in Dakar. It turned out to be one of the best experiences of my life. For that reason, this movie for me is a 10! No one ever said that a film had to win Oscars in every category to have a profound effect on the viewer. This one did it for me and that is why I watch it whenever it's on TV. Unfortunately, so many years have passed, that no channel shows it anymore. Ah, if only there were a DVD. I'd buy it immediately.
45	A Concorde with a terrible paint job and a passenger list of half-wits begins to have trouble in the air.<br /><br />I didn't care that Mike Brady was the captain. I didn't care that Ben Cartwright was one of the airport big-shots. I didn't even care that when the plane wrecked and burst into a giant fireball, everybody on board would die a bloody screaming death. As a matter of fact, I was hoping for the plane to explode. Yeah, that would be good, because then I could see every one of these dildoes fry and watch them float down to earth in a shower of bacon bits.<br /><br />Thank you for burning beyond recognition with Dumbbell Airlines.
46	Here's a an idea  let's round-up a bunch of Hollywood has-beens, second rate TV actors, and a bunch of no-names and put them all on board a cross Atlantic flight. And let's add a crazed mechanic with a grudge. Oh, and how about adding a deadly virus that fills the plane? You've got the recipe for a 1970s TV movie-of-the-week! <br /><br />How many of these doomed airplane movies did they make? If you believed what you saw at the movies and on television, planes were dropping out of the skies like flies in the 70s. These kinds of movies were all the rage and SST: Death Flight was meant to grab onto the disaster-cycle coattails. I'll give the movie credit, though  it's actually not much worse than most of the rest of its ilk. The acting is what you would expect from the likes of Lorne Greene, Tina Louise, and Bert Convy. The manufactured tension comes across 30 years later as more humorous than anything else. The characters are cardboard cutouts with overly dramatized problems that can miraculously be solved in an hour or so. The one thing SST: Death Flight has going for it is a slightly unusual twist at the end where the characters the choice of life or death. Other than that, it's cookie-cutter 70s disaster film-making at it's best (or worst, depending on how you look at this stuff.)
47	This is one classic disaster movie from the late 1970's. Starring: Billy Crystal, Lorne Greene, Peter Graves and Misty Rowe. ''Death Flight'' begins with a scene of a silver, white, red and orange supersonic passenger jet which looks like a Concorde with four turbo-engines from a 747, two on each wing, flying through the sky. Next we see Capt. Jim Walsh played by Robert Reed making announcements to his cabin supervisors to not worry about going twice the speed of sound to his crew members.<br /><br />Next are the movies main titles at JFK airport in New York. The story of this movie revolves around 7 crew members, 250 contest winners turned passengers and a deadly flu virus. One hour after takeoff, the first flight of America's first S.S.T. is struck by, in this order: an on-board explosion due to faulty hydraulic lines, three crew members burning to death on-board, and last but not least, a virus being released. After many attempts to land at various worldwide airport's, the plane crashes and explodes in South Africa, leaving only most of the films main stars alive, and all of the extras dead naturally. One things for sure, if you can find this movie do not miss it. In total, so far, there are eight different versions of the movie on release, this includes foreign releases. <br /><br />For Irish TV, in the summers of 2004 and 2005, RTE ONE showed the ''Death Flight'' uncensored release at times between 12:15 a.m. and 12:30 a.m. Let's hope they show it again soon.
48	That so many good actors would get together in such a bad film. This movie's premise seems to be "take a cast, put them on an SST, and then subject them to trouble after trouble." I also find it hard to believe that so many good actors would have an off day every day of filming and at the same time. How many of their careers didn't get ruined by this film is beyond me, especially that of John de Lancie. Avoid this one at all costs. Airport '79 was a much better film, and Airplane! was a whole lot funnier.
49	A plethora of stars are here. I was surprised to see a fay Billy Crystal, annoying Regis, Mike Brady, Burgess, Ginger, Q, Peter Graves. It's Titanic in the sky as anything that can go wrong does go wrong on this plane's maiden voyage. Lots of sub plots are thrown at you and still no story can be found. I loved the realism of how passengers could easily walk up and down aisles freely during the flight. This wild ride couldn't end any faster for me.<br /><br />
50	This is a children's movie. Is it a great children's movie? No.<br /><br />But, it is an enjoyable children's movie. Sure Gamera looks like he was constructed at the last second out of an old shopping bag; and, Monster X looks like something that you pulled out of a Salvation Army drop-box. But, this movie has children as the main characters, doing the bulk of the heroics and making the bulk of the sound decisions...<br /><br />There are a tremendous number of plot-holes in this movie; but, if you've got children, and a little patience, you can enjoy ninety minutes of pig-headed adults, brave children and flying turtles...<br /><br />Also, there is a certain resemblance to the science fiction novel Blameless in Abaddon...anyone else notice?...
51	I said in my "Gamera vs Zigra" review that that was the worst of the Gamera films. I was mistaken, "Gamera vs Jiger" is the worst of the Gamera Films.<br /><br />Basically in this film Gamera must save mankind from Jiger. Jiger is a monster who came back because some construction workers take away a statue that supposedly keeps JIger from escaping. Jiger manages to stab Gamera in the neck and put some eggs into him that later hatch into little Jigers.<br /><br />First of all this film has the worst looking of any of Gamera's foes. Jiger looks pretty cheaply built and does not look all that interesting. Jiger is a female due to the fact that it lays eggs. Se had potential and looks kind of like a prehistoric amphibian with a fin on his back. Jiger can shoot spears out of her head and kind of hover over water by shooting gas out of her body???? Mainly Jiger's face just looks lame. Just a bad looking cheap monster.<br /><br />Gamera also is looking bad in this film. I do not know how many different Gamera suits were made but this one looks really bad.<br /><br />There are a lot of parts that I just thought were bad. Like how the two kids take a submarine into Gamera's body. I am not a big fan of traveling into the body of other creatures even in films, it just looks odd.<br /><br />The monster fighting is nothing new. Just same old stuff. The only really interesting aspect of this film is how Jiger infects Gamera with eggs of hers that later hatch inside of Gamera. But for the most part the monster action is not exciting and just the same old stuff.<br /><br />The dubbing is pretty bad as usual. Why would the one guy make a gun noise and gesture when telling everybody the two children should have taken the undersea gun with them. And did they really have to show the people cutting open the elephant trunk and pulling out all the larvae that were inside? Disgusting.<br /><br />A pretty bad monster film. The worst Gamera film I have ever seen. Not recommended.
52	For you stoogeheads who haven't seen this short, but have seen (and watched repeatedly) the original version 'CORNY CASANOVAS', then stick to watching that one and don't waste your time on this clunker. All of the Besser remaking Curly or Shemp shorts miss the mark, but this attempt is extremely putrid. Poor editing, and transitions from old to new footage (and vice-versa), horribly redone gags, Moe treating diaper Joe like a delicate 2 year old instead of cracking his skull like he did with Shemp & Curly. In short, it stinks!<br /><br />1.5/10
53	There are some exciting scenes in this movie but in general it is second-rate. The shoots are overextended, the characters are not life-like and some actors don't perform well either. I also didn't like multiple nationalist statements which have nothing to do with the plot. I guess the director intended to make his characters mysterious but instead they came out to be unnatural. We are supposed to see how different people successfully struggle with hard times in their lives. But two stories, the one of Carlos and that of Mikel, end up with nothing and the third, the story of Ana, makes a turn without any reason. The movie is very depressive but without any message that derives from it.
54	I recently saw this film at the Santa Barbara Film Festival in California. The person who introduced the film described it as being similar to "21 Grams". I agree with this statement, however, where "21 Grams" left me feeling sad and hopeless, I left this movie with a smile on my face and filled with optimism.<br /><br />Sceenwriter Alejandro Hernandez says the story is "about second chances and hope... hard times are only the prelude to something better." The movie poster proclaims "Life may be full of hard times, but it is ultimately worth it". This is the feeling it gave me.<br /><br />It is an ensemble piece full of some great Spanish actors (notably Leonor Watling and Javier Camera who give great performances). The characters lives intertwine as they deal with turning points in their lives.<br /><br />I gave it a 9 because I felt it was a little slow in places, but besides the pace, I think this film has a lot to offer and we can learn from it. The characters deal with struggles - from relationships ending, fear, work problems and low self esteem, but by confiding in others, they find ways to turn their lives around.<br /><br />I recommend this movie if you need a pick-me-up and if you enjoy Spanish cinema, because this is one of the best Spanish films I have seen recently.
55	The dazzling multistory "Hard Times (Malas Temporadas)" is clearly a masterpiece in foreign cinema. The film plays itself out as a latino "Magnolia" and one can question whether it pays homage to that film. Director Martin Cuenca develops an interconnecting puzzle of conflicted characters in modern Spain: you have your social worker mom who's teenage son entraps himself in his room each day in order to avoid interaction with others, you have your solitary ex-convict who stalks his former cellmate, you have your amateur pilot who dreams of going to Miami (talk about going to Hard Times! Just Kidding! Like former Florida Marlin Livan Hernandez said after winning the 1997 World Series "I Love Miami"), and you have your paraplegic beauty who plays high infidelity from her rich husband by sleeping with the Cuban (Yea! Cubans rule! Sorry! Being a Cuban American, just had to say it!). The hardening of this tangled web is the time when their lives intertwine into a central fixated message about the love of life. The cast was nothing short of stellar! Respected Spanish actor Javier Camera again demonstrates why the camera loves him with his astute performance as the ex-convict Mikel. Nathalie Poza was stunning as the stressed social worker mom Ana. Eman Xor Ona was sturdy as the Miami dreamer Carlos. The screenplay of "Hard Times" must have been a hard one to develop because of its crossover components but I do commend Cuenca and Alejandro Hernandez for their triumphant scribing effort. You will find yourself having a easy & good time and having a worthwhile cinematic experience when you go see "Hard Times (Malas Temporadas)". ***** Excellent
56	I saw this movie by accident and i love it since.<br /><br />I got the DVD and in quiet moments I dig it out and watch it again...<br /><br />It's one of those rare films that keeps you watching while the story is flying by. The Characters fits the story and I also like the energy between the characters. The chosen music is excellent and keeps everything together.<br /><br />I wouldn't say it's realistic, that a boy rapes an unconscious women. But who never dreamed of an unconscious girl..:P <br /><br />In the end Julietta tries to make everything work and that makes her character even more appealing. <br /><br />I love the persons and the Music. Great Film.<br /><br />And to the others, who always compare one film with another: Live is not that easy to compare. Like the title says. Greetings
57	Overall this film was well acted, at least on the part of the main characters.<br /><br />The major issue I had with the film was the fact that after this guy, Max, admits to raping Julietta (she is indignant and mad for a whole five minutes) she forgives him. At this point she is pregnant and doesn't know if it is Max or Jiri's kid, but breaks up with Jiri for no real reason and has dinner with Max. As a woman I found this whole part to the story to be completely far-fetched.<br /><br />I also found that the film's language was a lot stronger than I thought it would be and the sex scenes were quite...detailed.<br /><br />On the whole I didn't enjoy this film - the storyline's fault.
58	Christoph Stark's second film comes not so long after that trendy, popular flick 'Run Lola Run' by Tom Twyker. It must still be fresh in Stark's memory, because something in 'Julietta' smells derivatively of the latter film. While Twkyer's film was quirky, and combined music with fast-paced shots without being too "MTV" about it, you have to wonder what Stark really wanted to do.<br /><br />The plot is all rather banal: young, and in all probability, wealthy German youth party it up at the annual Love Parade in Berlin. The protagonist Julietta heads up with her friends from Stuttgart to see her boyfriend Jiri and promptly loses him in party fervour and drugged out disorientation. In her near-unconscious state she has what should be a disturbing encounter with Max - a DJ/producer with a sensitive heart even though he'd sleep with a woman when she's passed out.<br /><br />Julietta returns to Berlin with a dilemma on hand and meets up with Max again (who has been befriended by boyfriend Jiri), and of course, what unravels is a predictable case of three-way tension, and so-called matters of the heart.<br /><br />Stark's camera movements - often times rapid - and the bright hues of primary colours that fill the screen (Julietta in bright reds) are all affected attempts at being stylistic, but come off strained. It is as if he wants to make a film about youth culture and troubled emotions, absent parent figures and city life. But all he does is churn out a conventional tale with a supposedly unconventional twist in the plot. This twist in the plot is set to make us believe that men who take advantage of women may suffer profound guilt afterwards and have a compassionate heart. Itself characterized poorly in the figure of Max.<br /><br />There's neither alluring style, nor substance to this film. An absolute waste of time. A pity, because lead actress Lavinia Wilson offers a promising performance which is wasted on this film.
59	Overall this film was well acted, at least on the part of the main characters.<br /><br />The major issue I had with the film was the fact that after this guy, Max, admits to raping Julietta (she is indignant and mad for a whole five minutes) she forgives him. At this point she is pregnant and doesn't know if it is Max or Jiri's kid, but breaks up with Jiri for no real reason and has dinner with Max. As a woman I found this whole part to the story to be completely far-fetched.<br /><br />I also found that the film's language was a lot stronger than I thought it would be and the sex scenes were quite...detailed.<br /><br />On the whole I didn't enjoy this film - the storyline's fault.
60	This german movie is one of this boring serious german movies filmed year after year to burn money which is better used for good movies.<br /><br />To forget this, it begins at the "Loveparade" in Berlin, with very very wild beats and a shaky very very modern camera. A couple had sex somewhere, get lost and the girl - full of drugs - is raped by the man who gets her out of the water of a fountain while she is sleeping. Some weeks later she realizes her pregnancy, came back to berlin and in the chaos of boyfriend, his friend (the raper), a drugdealer and her parents she searches for her way to future. It's a terrible film, in every scene the raper is full with conscious of guilt. The poor guy. No punishment. Only comprehension for his emotions.
61	This is a perfect example of a series that long outlived its usefulness. I loved Pinky and the Brain and watched the show almost religiously, but when some dunderhead at the WB decided to pair these mice with Elmyra, I was horrified. There was absolutely no reason to take them away from Acme Labs except that the show had just run out of ideas. This was an example of the expression "jumping the shark"--it was obvious it was all downhill for the show from then until its cancellation--and with crappy episodes without the original formula, it wasn't long before the show breathed its last. Frankly, I just found it embarrassing to watch towards the end. My recommendation is never watch this incarnation of the show and use massive amounts of denial. Convince yourselves and others it never occurred---the ONLY shows that ever existed were Animaniacs and Pinky and the Brain. They NEVER paired the mice with Elmyra--no, never!!
62	"Captain Salvation" could have been a segment of "Intolerance." In 1840, faced with blind discrimination, unfounded gossip and strict religious judgment, Anson Campbell, a seminary student, retreats to the sea. There, through a series of unfortunate events, he is reborn to his faith, 'baptized' by the fallen woman who has enlightened him. <br /><br />Most performances are standard, but Pauline Starke's work is excellent. George Fawcett's character, Zeke, provides some of the story transitions by being around when the transitions occur. It is a critical function in silent movies too often provided by title cards alone(in talkies, by a narrator or other dialog). Generally, this picture is very smoothly directed by John Robertson. <br /><br />Cinematography by William Daniels helps this picture shine. The new orchestral score by Philip Carli (TCM induced, I think)is great.
63	I was fortunate to be sent a copy of this movie after my plea. It was worth it as it was a far better movie than I had expected, it not being one of the most well known of silents. Everything about this movie was class and to top it all off, the soundtrack by Philip Carli was just perfect and the print was crystal clear. The direction by John Robertson was first class, again considering that he was not one of the more well known directors of the time and the photography was the usual high standard that we expect from William Daniels. The cast were all excellent, Lars Hanson was superb as the tormented title character Anson Campbell, he has been accused of over acting, but, Anson Campbell is a man who is losing his faith and heading for a mental breakdown to boot and Hanson portrays that with chilling clarity at times, though admittedly he was a little over wrought in some later sequences. Pauline Starke was absolutely amazing as Bess Morgan, she made you care so much about her and you truly believed in her character as a woman who has endured so much sadness and has hit rock bottom as a whore, but, is willing to seek redemption and change her life. Marceline Day was excellent as Mary Phillips, so much in love with Anson, but, still putting her faith ahead of her heart. This was a film that questioned the personal interpretation Christian charity in a manner that I found surprising for a film of that time All the cast was superb and the settings of a small New England harbour town was excellent, the shipwreck scene was very well done. All in all an excellent movie and if TCM show then I recommend it 100%. Special thanks to Paul, without whom I'd have never seen this treat. Hey TCM UK, when are you going to show more silent classics like you do on the other side of the pond?
64	As was noted by Cine Tiger, this excellent silent film was offered by Turner Classic Movies on their Sunday Night Silent feature.<br /><br />"Captain Salvation" was beautifully photographed, and although it does show the difference in the movie-making of that day to this day, it was a captivating journey. Marcelline Day was simply excellent in this film. My original vote for this drama was a 6 but after reflection, I raised the vote to a 7 because some of the scenes were so very haunting.<br /><br />The newly added soundtrack for "Captain Salvation" was most enjoyable.<br /><br />Plaudits all around to the restoration team, to the music composer, and to the Turner Classic Movies channel and its executives. This was a great film to restore and it was definitely an enchanting story to view on a quiet Sunday night. This movie also gives the lie to those modern cynics who say that spiritual or religious themes in movies are passe' or "old hat." Not so. Granted, this was truly a '20s movie and the 1920's had an element of resurgent Christian fundamentalism in that era, a resurgence which contrasted so very sharply with the age of "flappers, flivvers, and fol-de-rol".<br /><br />With many other classics of the '20s awaiting restoration, we can only hope for the best and for the immediate rescue of these cultural documents from our true American history !! Let's hope TCM shows this one again and again.
65	When I first saw this movie, I was around 9 or 10 years old. This is William Castle's first "official" horror movie. There are no monsters in it and no killers, at least no "graphic" killings, but for some reason, this has always been one of my favorite William Castle movies. I remember watching it real late at night. I think the intro and the end credits were somehow "scary" to me. At the end, as the credits are rolling, there is a cartoon of a "macabre" parade walking by. I still remember that to this day. One of the cartoon characters is carrying his own head. I'm 50 years old now and it's funny how a person can remember insignificant stuff like that over the years. I sure wish this movie would be released on DVD. I would love to see it in crystal clarity like the other William Castle movies that have been released on DVD.
66	I finally saw this on TV several years ago and wish I had taped it. It's got strong story elements that could have been developed into something really great.<br /><br />The idea of a funeral to be held at night because the deceased, the daughter of a very wealthy man, had been blind sets the tone. Add a race against time to save a kidnapping victim who's been buried alive and you've got the elements of a tidy thriller.<br /><br />My understanding is that the novel this was based on, THE CONCRETE GARDEN if I remember the title correctly, was actually written by several mystery writers. It was a project where writer A came up with the concept and wrote opening, then passed it to writer B who developed it and threw in complications that would make writer C sweat bullets to resolve. The fact that there were so many writers involved seems to have made it very difficult to get the rights to the story, and that's why it's the only one of William Castle's thrillers not available on video.<br /><br />We've seen remakes of several of Castle's works. Maybe someone will discover this one and get the rights issue resolved.
67	William Castle's first excursion into the horror genre is not really scary at all. It's a mild murder mystery about several dislikable characters, one of them presumably having committed a grizzly crime. It gets bogged down midway with some flashback sequences which really don't help the narrative THAT much. The performances are well acted and the film manages to keep a decent level of intrigue and curiosity throughout. It's also unusual to see Jim Backus in a rather unlikable role. However, being advertised as a "horror" film, it fails to provide enough ample shocks to please in that department and it lacks some of the chills and humorous touches of Castle's later work. Still, it's worth a look as the first of the William Castle "gimmick" films.
68	Loved this show as a kid, about 18 years ago. I always had a vague memory about the show, and could never find information about it. Thank you for helping me find this, IMDb users! From what I do remember about the show, at the beginning of each episode, a guy crawled through a log to get access to a secret clearing in the woods. There, he would play his guitar and sing songs. The show aired sometime in the 80's and perhaps early 90's. <br /><br />By any chance, does anyone remember a show which would air around the same years as this show where there was a woman walking around with a net. I can't remember if she was catching bugs or animal watching. Does this ring a bell for anyone?
69	It is a rare event when I rate a movie on the level of a 10, but if I could, I would go even higher for this film. I grew up with many films like this. Cartoon fantasies including "BFG", "The Brave Frog", "The Hobbit", and even "Wizards"... but none quite effected me on the level of this brilliant movie. While, when I was young, I did not capture the fantastic beauty of such a sweet story, I did feel something that nothing else gave me. Something... perfect. I only wish I could find it, and sadly I cannot.<br /><br />The story is, as many say, somewhat themed after Shakespeare's classic "Romeo & Juliet", however, the mixture of vibrant Fantasy and animation makes this far more memorable (And I am a lover of R&J). This is, in my truest of hearts, THE movie to me. There is no better movie, and there is no film that means more.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone with a child in their heart, and passion in their soul. It is a wonderful piece of cinematic genius, and I know that if I could only find it... I could reclaim a piece of my wondrous childhood.<br /><br />If you ever find this, obtain it and hold onto it. You do not know what a beautiful Gem you possess.
70	This movie could very well have the best original score I've ever heard, which is saying a lot because I pay close attention to such things. So, Koichi Sugiyama, thank you for your excellent work. That is the main reason why I voted a 10 on this movie. The film is quite a bit silly at times, but otherwise flawless. I just wish more people had seen it. Friendship, sacrifice, loyalty, destiny, fate, and love... Like I said, "Wow."
71	In my opinion, this is an absolutely romantic masterpiece about breaking rules to be together. If you ask me, the law about children of fire and children of water was absolutely pointless. You'll have to see the movie if you want to know why. On the other hand, Malta (voice of Mami Koyama) was a very beautiful young woman. I believe that she and Sirius (voice of Tôru Furuya) were truly meant for each other. To me, the setting was beautiful, the cast was well chosen, and the writing was strong. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved in this film did very well. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this absolutely romantic masterpiece about breaking rules to be together to all of you who haven't seen it. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.
72	Here is another rarely-seen anime film I had watched online, and after I did I love it. it's a beautifully-animated fantasy about two star-crossed lovers from opposite sides : Fire & Water. You know, I didn't know Sanrio, creator of Hello Kitty (and all the other cuddley characters we love) maded this film; but now I do.<br /><br />The feud between Fire and Water started along time ago, when the two siblings, Oceanus - God of Water (Sirius' father), and Hyperia - Goddess of Fire (Malta's mother), lived in peace and dearly loved each other. However, the God of Wind, Algaroc, become jealous of the pair's happiness, and spread lies and deceit between them until their hatred for each other brought about war. Finally, Algaroc was imprisoned by the King of Gods himself, but after that time, the brother and sister still despised each other, so the Children of Fire and Water forever remained apart. Years later, Prince Syrius of the Water and Princess Malta of the Fire meet and fall in love, and they meet in secret.
73	I loved this film when I was a kid and I know a lot of you have been having difficulty finding a copy. I found this guy online that makes DVD transfers of the film on English dub with menus and everything:<br /><br />http://8store.8thman.com/ta3.htm<br /><br />I ordered the import from Japan as well but that doesn't have English subs or dubs. I think these transfers will be true to the childhood experience we remember.<br /><br />I remember watching this film over and over on a VHS tape when I was little but that tape has long gone and I am aching for a DVD version. Hopefully Sanrio reproduces this classic on DVD because there is definitely a cult following. I've been seeing bootlegs of this going for as much as $70 on eBay!
74	The last time I saw this film must have been nearly fifteen years ago. During that time, although I had forgotten the title entirely, there were aspects of this film that stuck in my brain and likely contributed to a few random dreams; I remember not really following the plot as a child, but I recalled finding it A) very beautiful, and B), unbelievably dark. Certain scenes and characters have stayed with me with dogged persistence---a swarm of jellyfish that seem to electrocute or burn their victims to death rather than poisoning them; the deaths of two juvenile characters that hammer home the realization that, like in the film *Cube*, every last character is expendable; and the image that probably haunted me most of all, the scene towards the end involving a forced cocooning that speaks volumes about parental coercion and a pigheaded refusal to see reason. Many reviewers have compared the story to Romeo & Juliet, and although I wouldn't have understood the analogy as a child, I'm sure I recall the realization that, however majestic and omnipotent the combatants (Sea and Fire, in this case), the conflict presented is nothing more than a childish feud, a pointless and senseless sparring match that will probably never see a true victory. Pretty disturbing themes for a film allegedly for children! Now that I have recently rediscovered the title(s), I would greatly enjoy finding this film again, if only for old time's sake. It's rare that a film leaves such a long impression on me, and for all those out there who also were touched by this film, I'd recommend it in a double billing with Martin Rosen's *Watership Down*, a similarly lovely and chilling animation.
75	I have always loved this movie. I don't know how my dad bought it but it must have been popular in the states when I was young. It is my favorite animated movie because of how beautiful it is. I used to pretend I was Princess Malta every night before I went to bed. Please try to find and see it if you are a lover of pretty things. My favorite thing about this movie is how sacrifice is romanticized. The only downside is the overused Romeo and Juliet theme, albeit, the story deviates from the older story enough to fool younger viewers. Malta is drawn very beautifully and so is Oceanus, the sea god. It is very dreamy and beautiful to journey into the world of "The Sea Prince and the Fire Child."
76	I have been in search of childhood anime for awhile now. This movie was at the top of my list. I haven't watched it since I was very young. I remember renting it over and over. The story line is very interesting and playful. I loved every character in the movie. The pictures and the way the animation was drawn was one of my favorite things. The score for the film gave me goosebumps even as a small child. Definitely a must for any anime fan. I was overwhelmed with excitement when Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind came back into print on DVD this year. Maybe this movie will come back into print, but I doubt it due to the risqué nature of the film and modern definition of G rated movies. Absolutely Great movie. Hope I get to see it again soon.
77	As far back as I can remember, my sisters and I have been fascinated with this film. I guess that would be my whole life since I was born in 81! We had a tape of Sea Prince and the Fire Child and it was watched so often that it started to deteriorate. My father would get mad because we didnt care if we ruined the vrc as long as we could watch our movie. I wish I could find another copy of it as ours went 'mysteriously missing'! My favourite character would have to be Bibble. If i remember correctly thats his name. But the summary says the fire child's name is Marta! I guess the way Sirius always said it made us confused because we called her Malta. But really, this is one of the best memories of my childhood. If anyone knows where I can get a tape, let me know!
78	Jacob Wade (Jack Palance) used to be a celebrated shootist just stepping into middle age and mortally weary of having to be asked to leave every town he rides into To make matters worse, a few notorious outlaws, led by the vile King (Neville Brand), are also out to take him down <br /><br />Now he tries to do something for his boy Riley (Anthony Perkins) by catching and breaking mustangs in Echo Canyon, the best wild horse country in the territory <br /><br />Complicating the situations further is Jacob's bad relationship with a kid who hates him, and Ada Marshall (Elaine Aiken), a young woman whom Jacob met in a gambling hall, and shot a man on account of her<br /><br />Here is a thinking person's Western that deals with one ex-gunman who also is unable to shake his past and whose ultimate goal for taking root again is by lynching <br /><br />Levin shows a dark, depressing, and sadly realistic face of the west... In fact, the entire movie is a drama of characters But watching the film, you would be able to feel how Levin equates victory with redemption
79	Since childhood I've found the actors playing the bad guys more interesting than the main characters,at least till about 1970 or so.Many that I viewed in the 1950's didn't last long in a movie or TV program because they were an early victim to the star.Some eventually went on to make names for their selves but for the most part I liked them more when playing minor roles.Some of those minor role villains are in this movie and I found them very entertaining.There's Neville Brand playing King Fisher,a good performer but sometimes a little bit to scary even for me when dealing out punishment.Others like Faro (Lee Van Cleef),Sundown Whipple(John Doucette) and Blackburn(Claude Akins) are in top menacing form.While not a household name another quality performer is Robert Middleton playing Ben Ryerson.Whether playing a politician or a mob boss he gives a quality performance.In this movie he's a bit grubby looking but handy with both a gun and a knife.Then there's Willie (Elisha Cook Jr) one of Fisher's men.He usually bursts into a room big eyed bearing news but has to grab a quick drink before speaking.So much to my delight the cast includes a rouge's gallery of personal favorites,almost like a dream come true.For those who like the good guys the movie leans more towards a nightmare.Jack Palance plays Jacob Wade the main character.As usual he has the look of a strong tough looking man.His performance is better than usual but that just means it's not as stiff as usual.The story lacks a bit of direction also.Those two points are forgotten because of Anthony Perkins who plays Jacob Wade's son Riley.His part lacks direction or maybe a director as it seems like he or someone else wants to sabotage this movie.First off he's too old and big to be playing the part of the son.When he does show some sign of a emotion it's fitting more for someone at least 10 years younger than him.To the simple statement that his mother(deceased) was a fine woman he responds blandly"talk about my mother again and I'll kill you",really off the wall.Elaine Aiken gives a good performance and is nice looking.In another comment it was basically said her character with it's good qualities has no reason to be interested romantically in the wimpy Perkins character,that's hitting the nail on the head.So this movie was just about what I expected,the minor roles out shining the main characters.One of the main characters looked like a good friend must of gave them the part.
80	This film has a lot going for it. It was done in Vistavision a process that gave a superior quality to the film on the screen, and unusually in black and white, since most of the films in Vistavision were in color. The cinematography is great, specially when it shows the wild horses being chased and captured. It has three excellent performances by Jack Palance, Tony Perkins and most of all by Elaine Aiken. Palance is a gunfighter who wants to change his lifestyle but knows that the odds are against it. But he takes upon himself the mission of turning his revolted son Tony Perkins into a better person. In this task he is helped by his former mistress Elaine Aiken with whom he wants no more involvement. There is quite a sensual chemistry between Aiken and Perkins. I wonder why such a talented, good looking woman like Aiken made so few films. It is very hard for a normal father son relationship to develop between Palance an Perkins, and director Henry Levin handles it very well, making the film come to a very satisfactory ending.
81	This isn't the cowboys vs. indians or "saved by the Cavalry" formulaic western. There is characterization! Jack Palance delivers a great performance. He can act when the script and director allowed him. Tony Perkins seems to be the same character as he was in Tin Star. Great outdoor scenery; the studio should have paid the extra cost to film this in Technicolor.
82	This film has got merit not least the photography. It is beautifully shot and the location has much to admire. There is a touch of John Ford in parts. Its main strength is the performance by Jack Palance. Anthony Perkins is ok but he has not a lot to do. Small parts by familiar actors adds to the attractions of the film which is well worth a viewing. One of my childhood best loved films which I was not disappointed with when I watched it recently.
83	I found "Lonely Man' in a local library. I can't believe it only has 26 votes on the IMDB. This is not as great as the Anthony Mann films I've studied in grad school. There is one with Anthony Perkins called "The Tin Star" which I would recommend more. But, this is still a good Western which doesn't follow the conventional theme/structure narrative. Worth a look.
84	I found it hard to view the user comments on this film because of all the partisan ranting from demagogues of both parties. Therefore, I am going to try and leave my own political persuasions out of this review although I definitely have a viewpoint about what was happening in Iraq and the need for US involvement there.<br /><br />*** This may contain spoilers, although this is a simple documentary with no plot, so there ain't much to spoil.*** <br /><br />After all the hype about Michael Moore's slanted, biased, and intellectually dishonest film Fahrenheit 911, and all the celebrity hubbub about how George Bush is an evil so-and-so and our involvement in Iraq was simply about obtaining oil, I thought I might have a look at what the other side (who gets far less sensationalistic coverage in the national media) had to say about the whole situation. I had heard that this documentary was particularly brutal and difficult to watch, but I thought it was important to see just what was going on in Iraq before the US dismantled Saddam Hussein's regime.<br /><br />It was brutal, it was grotesque, and it was very difficult to sit through. We are treated to footage of people's arms stretched out across two concrete blocks and then being broken with axe handles; we see fingers hacked off, then the screaming, bleeding victim tossed aside to fend for himself; we see hands amputated surgically and tongues clipped outall these horrific atrocities committed by way of punishment in the name of "justice". We see torture, murder, and disturbing footage of women being publicly shot or stoned to death for "crimes" such as adultery.<br /><br />My problem is that the documentary, hosted by some boring, no-name yobbo in a suit and tie, frequently wanders from its supposed focus in favor of showing gruesome footage. At first it feels, albeit unpleasant, at least informative; however, as the film wears on, it becomes even more unpleasant, loses its informative nature, and begins to feel distinctly exploitative in tone. I found that shift in tone more disturbing than the film itself. The film ends with every videotaped beheading they could find. I had seen many when they were current news, believing it important to see what the enemy (terrorists and radical religious fundamentalists) was all about, but I just couldn't stomach re-watching these cold-blooded, grotesque murders again, presented as they were in the guise of "infotainment", and turned the movie off.<br /><br />In some ways this film shows some important things that were happening within Hussein's Iraq that folks like Sean Penn either didn't see or chose to ignore. It will make you appreciate living in a free country where you don't have your tongue cut out or your hands amputated for displeasing a mad dictator. The US got involved in Bosnia and Somalia based on concern for the genocide occurring there, how could we in fairness turn a blind eye to Iraq? Saddam Hussein actively and arrogant defied every UN sanction and action taken against him, including those he agreed to in order to end the war in 1991, but the UN clearly wasn't going to do anything about it, especially with corrupt UN officials making under-the-table deals with Hussein. Who else but the US would have taken steps to correct this injustice? These are all good points made in the beginning of the film.<br /><br />But the film's weakness is where it loses its focus on the reasons we went there and simply becomes a parade of gore, brutality, and murder. Although it has its good points, I can't in good conscience recommend it as a good, well-made documentary.<br /><br />Cheers <br /><br />Brent
85	This was a waste of time. Out of context video meets out of context prejudice. Quotes are taken from Democrats in supposed support of a war in Iraq (predicated on intelligence provided by the Bush administration) and are seamlessly narrated by our helpful nobody ra-ra, 'my way or the highway', war mongering nobody commentator. The videos are graphic, real and disturbing, but out of place and badly analyzed.<br /><br />Please, put your time to better use. This film will either make you hate 'Islamic Extremists', the 'Radical Left' or just yourself for giving this garbage the time of day.
86	I got this movie in the mail a few days ago. I watched it in black and white cause the colour would not appear on my DVD player. Anyway, i saw the whole movie and i was not very pleased about it. The host Mark Taylor a large man in dress suit which tell about what you will see next and say TO MANY times: What you are about to see next is shocking!. Yes, a few things are shocking like the scenes where iraq soldiers breaks bones on prisoners. They also cut tongues of people. At one stage in movie Mark Taylor ask us make up our minds on this: What is worst the Abu Ghraib prison case or what the Iraq army does to people. We are then shown a series of non brutal images from the Abu Ghraib prison followed by extreme grotesque videos from Iraq. This is wrong.<br /><br />The movie it self is very good produced. Good image quality and some neat extra features. But i find this movie to politically incorrect. I have much movies in this genre (shockumentary) but i tend to like them best when they stay without any political views.
87	Iraq was in a terrible way LONG before the American came. Saddam was the modern day Stalin and Hitler. Gasing people with different political and religious views and torturing his own people. In the film they show many actual evidence of these acts. They even go back with recored audio of John Kerry agreeing with the invasion of Iraq along with Senetor Clinton and Kennedy.<br /><br />I however like the comparison with the Saddam era Abu Gharib and the American Abu Gharaib. Neither are acceptable but Saddams was MUCH WORSE! We ALL need to see this. <br /><br />10 out of 10. Two thumbs WAY UP!
88	The only thing that I can think when reading the negative comments left for this movie is that the people who wrote them have *clearly* never temped. As someone who spent four years of his life wasting away in other people's cubicles, I can tell you with complete authority that this movie gets every mind-numbing, insulting, and degrading aspect of the experience dead on. I suppose you should be thankful if you can't relate to what's going on in this film because it probably means you've never had to tip-toe into some middle manager's office on a Friday afternoon to get a signature on your time card.<br /><br />As for those who think "Clockwatchers" is "dull" or "boring," it's called subtly. Look into it.
89	I suppose the viewers who label Clockwatchers "boring" simply don't understand that dramas are MEANT to be slower than your garden-variety Indiana Jones or Die Hard. These "action" flicks are ten-times as dull as the corporate setting for this astonishing study on class, friendship, and inner-awareness. Or maybe it is the female perspective or "chick-flick" factor that turn certain people off. Or maybe temporary status in modern American business isn't relevant to everyone. Or the subtle, less gimmicky observations of reality.<br /><br /> Clockwatchers is all of these things at once. Toni Collette plays the ultra-shy newcomer to Global Credit, the ultimate transnational corporation, who slowly comes to realize that the doomed bond she makes with three other temps is an extremely sacred event in her life. Iris slowly gains confidence through such comradery and at one point she doesn't want to leave, even though her father has higher career expectations for his daughter. Iris comes full circle at the end of the film, confronts one of her many bosses whom plot against her, and atones for not standing with Parker Posey, who is the life of the party as Margaret.<br /><br /> The creators of this film are SO incredibly accurate in revealing what worklife is actually like (the boredom, sharing someone else's space, not knowing someone's name or them not knowing yours), that I felt almost honored to know I wasn't alone. (Movies that are this honest about despair are never depressing.) This is combined by the subtle observations of Iris, which I suppose aren't as exciting as blowing someone's head off or toilet humor, but intriguing nonetheless. It is finally layered with political analysis as the female temps organize a strike. <br /><br /> Suffice it to say, Clockwatchers covers a lot of ground, but the layers are folded well together in a way that makes you care about what happens to these characters and their station in life. A must-see sleeper for those who prefer (for example) Merchant & Ivory over Van Damme & Seagal. 9 out of 10.
90	Some of the earlier reviewers have called "Clockwatchers" dull, pointless and have asked why it was made. My question for these reviewers is: What movie were you watching? Is there another movie with a similar title out there? This movie is incredible!<br /><br />No, it's not a "There's Something About Mary" farce. No, there aren't any explosion and no one is killed. (Someone does die... but that happens off camera and we don't see any blood.) The comedy here is of the subtle, "funny because it is true" variety. If you've ever had a job, any job, the comedy in this movie cannot escape you.<br /><br />Parker Posey once again shows us that she is one of the finest comic actresses alive. And, contrary to what others have said, this is not a one note performance. She is at once obnoxious, brash, funny and fun...and yet, very vulnerable, struggling so hard to be recognized and very terrified of where her life is headed.<br /><br />I could give similar praise to the performances of Toni Collette, Alanna Ubach and (believe it or not) Lisa Kudrow.<br /><br />Director Jill Sprecher (I will have to watch more from her) has aimed her dart at office politics: The pecking order, the self-absorption, the pointlessness of it all, the feeling of "Oh, how I would I love to leave this place but where would next month's rent come from?"...and Jill has hit the bullseye!<br /><br />
91	Jill Sprecher, the enormous talent behind "Clockwatchers", needs to be seen more often. We saw this witty comedy in its original debut and it was a pleasure to watch it again on IFC. Ms. Sprecher and her sister Karen wrote a delicious movie that is on the one level a satire about the way "temps" are used in an office, and it's at the same time, a character study about these four souls at the center of the movie.<br /><br />Each one of the young women in the film has a problem. They come together because they don't have a life on their own. Iris, Margaret, Paula and Jane, form a bond because they find safety in numbers. Iris is a clever girl whose shyness doesn't let her assert herself and is dragged along by the others that show stronger personalities. Margaret puts up a front, but deep down, she is just as vulnerable as the others. The most pathetic one is Paula, a woman who is pretending to be what she is not. Jane is waiting for the security of marriage to beat it out of being a temp.<br /><br />When the sneaky Cleo is hired as a permanent employee, the problems in the office are magnified. As things begin disappearing from the office, all eyes point to the four temps. That is the beginning of the end of the clique, as they knew it. Iris is the one that stays the longer and she is the one that discovers the mystery of the missing things in the office, but alas, it's too late, because at that time she leaves the temp job.<br /><br />Toni Collette, Parker Posey, Lisa Kudrow and Alana Ubach, are perfect as the four temps. Toni Collette has a better role where to shine as most of the story is seen through her eyes. Parker Posey is delightful as the free spirited Margaret. Lisa Kudrow also makes a good contribution with her pathetic Paula. Helen Firzgerald, who only has a few lines, cast a giant shadow as the creepy new employee that wants to make friends with Iris, only to be ignored.<br /><br />The Sprecher sisters created a film that feels real a situation one has seen is prevalent in the office setting.
92	I saw this on cable last night, just 2 days after seeing the Sprecher sisters' latest film, 13 Conversations About One Thing - that was the reason I stayed up til 2:30 a.m. to watch it, in fact (please read my review of 13 Conversations, posted yesterday). This film is linear - one scene following the other chronologically - and therefore not as challenging to the viewer as 13 Conversations, but it does leave its mark (as one character in the movie has been told to do). <br /><br />Writer/Director Jill Sprecher is extremely adept in nailing down specifics, and this gift for detail is in full evidence here. The film is about fear, lunch hours, pettiness, toilet paper, loneliness, rubber band balls, despair, paper clips, friendship, pencils, desperation, cocktail garnishes, anger - downright fury, actually - at being marginalized by the illusion of society - and much more. Toni Collette's face is still in my memory - her terrified-to-do-or-say-the-wrong-thing rabbit eyes, her rapture at feeling connected to her 3 fellow temp workers (and specifically, seeing her nose crinkle the way it does when she smiles), the desolation of seeing their bond destroyed by wretched but inevitable bone-chilling office politics and fear. <br /><br />It's a small slice of life, Clockwatchers, but it's an important slice, one that anyone who has ever interacted with anyone on a daily, money-driven basis can relate to. If you've ever held a job, I'm saying, you will see yourself mirrored in at least some of these meticulous details.
93	Blistering black comedy co-written by Jill Sprecher (who also directed) and Karen Sprecher, "Clockwatchers" gives us a suffocating office setting so vivid and real I half-expected my own co-workers to show up in it. Toni Collette plays the new temporary in a nondescript building wherein office-incidentals are slowly disappearing from the supply cabinet. The ensemble acting is delightfully accurate, and the strife which ensues in this scenario is comically overwrought and horrifying. Sprecher's direction is focused and brave (no overtures to broadly comical sensibilities), and she nimbly stretches the film's satirical edge quite far without faltering. The movie is a genuine American original, and by the final third I couldn't wait to see it again from the start. ***1/2 from ****
94	Is this movie slow? Occasionally boring? Kind of depressing? Yes. Unfortunately, that is the reality of working as a temp in an office! Take it from one who's been there. I spent several years temping on breaks from college in the late 80s, and this movie brought it all back, vividly. The office politics, the way the permanent workers "look down" on the temps, the menial and mind-numbing tasks, the good old boys (mostly white males, at that time) who were in charge and above it all. Not all of my jobs were as horrible as the office depicted in this movie, but enough were that it occasionally gave me chills. I hope that things have improved, with the proliferation of computers and other advanced technology, at least in terms of the work itself. But I can guarantee that in some places, that temp vs. perm "caste system" will always be there, regardless of how the jobs get done.<br /><br />The performances in the movie were excellent. I really liked Parker Posey's exuberant portrayal, as well as Toni Collette's studied, more subtle effort. She expresses so much pain and frustration through her facial expressions and quiet, even-toned narration.<br /><br />The movie is not for everyone, and some viewers will no doubt be bored and/or confused by it. But if you've ever been a temp of any kind, or worked in an office, I think it will resonate with you.
95	When the credits started for "Clockwatchers" - Toni Collette, Parker Posey and Lisa Kudrow - the senior citizens around me in the art house theater complained they hadn't heard of anybody. (There were also choice bit roles by James Elliott of "Jag," Bob Balaban and Paul Dooley and they didn't recognize them either.) There was a row of young kids in the front for some reason who talked as much as the seniors through the movie and kept going in and out to get food and slamming the door. All of which is hard to take during a comedy. <br /><br />This is a great movie for those of us in unsatisfactory office cubicle jobs - ideal for those in temp hell. Not necessarily laugh out loud funny all the way through but biting social satire about office life today for those at the bottom end of a ladder that doesn't go anywhere.<br /><br />Collette's central character is almost too bland and vacant towards the end as there's no ringing conclusion just some small revenges, but it's all in character and place. <br /><br />Kudrow gets to be a bit nastier and practical life-facing than her usual roles.<br /><br />Clearly the sister creators of this movie have spent some time as temps! And temporary office placement companies are now the largest employers in the country.<br /><br />(originally written 5/26/1998)
96	I'm surprised how many people see this as a boring film that does nothing but chronicle the minutiae of modern-day office life. 'Clockwatchers' is a relationship film which also examines the lives of the new breed of second-class citizen in the late 20th century workplace, the temp.<br /><br />Iris (Toni Collette) is a meek temporary hire who stands out about as much as the Muzak at her new assignment, a large credit firm. Luckily she's taken under the wing of Margaret (Parker Posey), the Artful Dodger of the firm's temps who shows her how to survive in this impersonal world. Along with Paula (Lisa Kudrow) and Jane (Alanna Ubach) they form an us-against-them support group and Iris begins to come out of her shell as a person as well. Soon Margaret is conducting a guerilla war against a permanent hire (Helen FitzGerald) who gets a job Margaret had been aiming for and who is almost a mirror image of Iris when she came to work a few weeks before. The office drama is played out in great detail, and the solidarity of the temps is one of the war's casualties.<br /><br />This is a fine, above-average first effort from director Jill Sprecher, who wrote the screenplay with her sister Karen. She's obviously keen to show her skills here, and sometimes she directs the movie like it was 'Citizen Kane,' but that's not much of a fault. A little more serious problem is that after its climax the film loses some steam moving towards the denouement, but overall the screenwriting sisters have produced an entertaining film that speaks with authority on its subject. Let's hope they find regular employment.
97	With the movie market being so saturated with cheesy action and overplayed drama flicks, what a breath of fresh air it is to see a movie about people that have REAL problems. Clockwatchers captures all the essences of the work place, the monotony, the hierarchy, and all the nuances of tedious day to day temp work. Here you have 4 women who are capable of so much more in their life, yet they're so afraid to act on their dreams that they settle for crappy temp jobs. Excellent acting by Toni Collette in the lead role as "Iris." Nods to Parker Posey as well. All the girls nailed their parts strongly, and the strong acting along with a great script created a very real and believable story with real and believable characters. Definitely see it! 4 stars!
98	I enjoyed this movie. I rented it because it had Parker Posey in it, but enjoyed all of the characters. Maybe because I've had jobs like that before : the sense of "us vs. them" and the wacky little things that the characters did to get through the day to 5:00. I would rather watch a movie about these four girls than most movies readily offered to me. Watch the movie. Enjoy it. There aren't that many great movies where the female characters aren't just there to give a guy character some depth.
99	Many of you have posted comments on "Clockwatchers" as a portrayal of "Office Life"... Not true!! It is a movie based on each of the 4 main characters personal "Identity Struggle" and nothing more than that. Watch it again and "Forget" that they are in an "Office" setting, focus on the personalities you see in each of the 4 main characters.<br /><br />I'll give you a hint, Lisa Kudrow's character has Bulimia Nervosa.<br /><br />Guess who has OCD?<br /><br />"Never ignore the Obvious and Never over-look the Obscure"<br /><br />A great Movie! 10 "stars"
100	That is exactly what I did while watching this movie. I watched the clock, hoping it would end soon.
